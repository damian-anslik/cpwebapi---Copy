If you do not have an account, you can [create one for free](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46380#open-account).\nFree trial accounts are not currently supported, however support for free trial accounts is coming soon. \n\n**Note:** The account creation process may take up to 48 hours to complete.\n\n---\n\n### Step Two: Download and unzip the Client Portal API Gateway\n\nIndividual clients using Client Portal API will need to use a Java-based API gateway in order to access protected endpoints.\nThe gateway is responsible for routing requests to the backend and ensuring that the brokerage session is authenticated.\nThe Client Portal API gateway can be downloaded <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041" target="_blank">here</a>, or, by clicking on the Gateway card in the Downloads section of this page.\n\n**Note:** Once a new version of the Client Portal API Gateway is released, it is recommended that you download this new version.\n\nDetails about new Gateway releases can be found in the <a href="./changelog">Changelog</a>.\n\n---\n\n### Step Three: Download and install Java\n\nAs the Client Portal API Gateway was built using Java, a working installation of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required. The minimum requirement is Java 8 update 192.\nIn order to check if you have a working installation of Java, open a terminal and run the following command:\n\n``` bash\njava --version\n```\n\nIf you do not have a working installation of Java, you can download it [from the official website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).\n\n---\n\n### Step Four: Configure the Client Portal API Gateway\n\nIf Java is installed and correctly configured you should see information about the currently installed version, otherwise an error is raised. An example response is the following:\n\n```bash\njava 17.0.1 2021-10-19 LTS\n```\n\nIf you don\'t currently have Java installed you can download it by clicking on the Java card in the Downloads section of this page.\n\n---\n### Step Four: Run the API Gateway\n\nUsing the terminal, navigate to the directory where the gateway has been unzipped. For example:\n\n```bash\ncd C:/Users/Example/Desktop/Cp Gateway\n```\n\nOn Windows, launch the gateway using the following command:\n\n```bash\nbin\\run.bat root\\conf.yaml\n```\n\nAnd in the case of Unix systems:\n\n```bash\nbin/run.sh root/conf.yaml\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step Five: Authenticate the brokerage session\n\nOnce the gateway is running, you will need to authenticate the session. In order to do so, navigate to <a href="https://localhost:5000">https://localhost:5000</a> on your local network and enter\nyour username and password. The message \'Client Login Succeeds\' is displayed if the login was successful.\n\n**Tip:** By default, the gateway will listen on port 5000. To change this update the conf.yaml file found in the \'root\' directory of the gateway.\n\n---\n\n### Where to go from here?\n\nEnsure your session is authenticated by following the tips and tricks on the [Authentication](./authentication) page.\n\nOnce you are successful in authenticating, review the available endpoints on the [Endpoints](./endpoints) page.\n\nWebsockets can retrieve and deliver streaming data. For more information on how to use websockets, see the [Websockets](./websockets) page.\n\nOnce you have reviewed pages above, go through the [Use Cases](./use-cases) page to understand the use cases.\n\n**Good luck! 🍀**\n\n---\n';var dt=ct;const pt="";var lt=pt;const ut=e=>((0,s.dD)("data-v-77b3a4ac"),e=e(),(0,s.Cn)(),e),yt={class:"download-card"},mt=["href"],ht={class:"header"},gt=ut((()=>(0,s._)("i",{class:"fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"},null,-1))),ft={class:"content"};function bt(e,t,i,r,n,o){return(0,s.wg)(),(0,s.iD)("div",yt,[(0,s._)("a",{href:i.url,target:"_blank"},[(0,s._)("div",ht,[(0,s._)("span",null,(0,u.zw)(i.title),1),gt])],8,mt),(0,s._)("div",ft,[(0,s._)("p",null,(0,u.zw)(i.content),1)])])}var vt={props:{title:{type:String,required:!0},url:{type:String,required:!0},content:{type:String,required:!0}}};const wt=(0,a.Z)(vt,[["render",bt],["__scopeId","data-v-77b3a4ac"]]);var Tt=wt;const It=e=>((0,s.dD)("data-v-2f7c7836"),e=e(),(0,s.Cn)(),e),At={class:"warning-container"},kt=It((()=>(0,s._)("i",{class:"fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"},null,-1)));function St(e,t){return(0,s.wg)(),(0,s.iD)("div",At,[kt,(0,s.WI)(e.$slots,"default",{},void 0,!0)])}const Ct={},qt=(0,a.Z)(Ct,[["render",St],["__scopeId","data-v-2f7c7836"]]);var xt=qt,Pt={components:{BaseLayout:ne,DownloadCard:Tt,AccountToggle:Z,Warning:xt},data(){return{content:null,store:Q(),downloads:[{title:"API Gateway",content:"Download the latest version of the Client Portal API Gateway",url:"https://download2.interactivebrokers.com/portal/clientportal.gw.zip"},{title:"Java",content:"Download the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment",url:"https://www.java.com/en/download/"}]}},watch:{content(){hljs.highlightAll()}},computed:{activeTab(){let e="individual"==this.store.accountType?dt:lt,t=marked.parse(e);return this.content=t,t}}};const Dt=(0,a.Z)(Pt,[["render",at],["__scopeId","data-v-caf5390c"]]);var Mt=Dt;const _t=e=>((0,s.dD)("data-v-42cc8505"),e=e(),(0,s.Cn)(),e),Et={class:"content-header"},Ot=_t((()=>(0,s._)("h2",null,"Authentication",-1))),jt=_t((()=>(0,s._)("p",null,[(0,s.Uk)(" When navigating to the Client Portal API Gateway login page, you may see a warning from your browser regarding a missing valid SSL certificate.

There is currently\nno official workaround for this requirement.\nOther Interactive Brokers' trading applications such as TWS or IBKR Mobile also utilize a brokerage session.\n\n**Note:** A given username can only create a single brokerage session at any given time. Launching TWS, IBKR mobile, logging in to Client Portal, or establishing a connection via third-party software using your Interactive Brokers' credentials, will disconnect the current Client Portal API brokerage session, and vice versa.\n\n---\n\n### How can I tell if my brokerage session is authenticated?\n      \nThe endpoint **/iserver/auth/status** can be used to determine the current authentication status of the session. \nOnce you have logged in using the Client Portal API Gateway, you can make a POST request to this endpoint to determine if your session is fully authenticated.\nIf the session is fully authenticated, the response from this endpoint will contain the following JSON object:\n        \n``` json\n{\n    'authenticated': true, \n    'connected': true, \n    'competing': false\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### How long does a session remain authenticated?\n\nTo ensure client account security, Interactive Brokers' trading solutions were designed with the need for the user to manually reauthenticate with the backend\non a daily basis. As such, the maximum period of time that a Client Portal API session can remain authenticated is 24 hours.\n\nDaily maintenance of IBKR's servers could result in a disconnect earlier than the 24 hour period mentioned above.\nWe advise disconnecting your session from your gateway and restarting it after the maintenance time to minimize any potential problems that may arise.\nInformation on server reset times and system status updates can be found on the [System Staus](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php) page.\n        \n---\n\n### How can I prevent the session from timing out?\n\nA Client Portal API brokerage session will timeout if no requests are received within a period of 5 minutes. In order to prevent the session from timing out, the \nendpoint **/tickle** should be called on a regular basis. It is recommended to call this endpoint approximately every\nminute. \n\nIf the brokerage session has timed out but the session is still connected to the IBKR backend, the response to **/auth/status** returns 'connected':true and 'authenticated':false.\nCalling the **/reauthenticate** endpoint will start a new brokerage session.\n\n---\n\n### Can I automate the Client Portal API authentication process?\n\nThere is currently no mechanism available on Interactive Brokers' end to permit individual clients to automate the\nbrokerage session authentication process when using Client Portal API.\n\n---\n\n### Can I use a third-party solution to automate the brokerage session authentication process?\n\nInteractive Brokers does not recommend the use of third-party solutions to establish a brokerage\nsession. This can put your account at risk from potentially malicious projects. \n\n**Note:** Interactive Brokers is unable to provide support for third-party wrappers.\n\n---\n\n### Is it possible to authenticate a live brokerage session without the use of a Two Factor Authentication (2FA) device?\n\nThe login process to the Client Portal API Gateway is the same as to Client Portal. As the Client Portal has access to sensitive information and \nbanking functionalities, two-factor authentication is mandatory for login.\n\n---\n";var Ft=Bt;const Nt="\n\n### Session based authentication\n\nSimilarly to individual clients, institutional clients can also use session based authentication. For instructions on how to set up session-based authentication using the Client Portal API Gateway please refer to the Quickstart guide for individual clients.\n\nA downside to this approach is that it requires a GUI to be present on the machine where the client is running to facilitate authentication. Nonetheless, this approach is a good starting point for testing and prototyping.\n\n---\n\n### OAuth based authentication\n\nIn addition to session based authentication via the API Gateway, Interactive Brokers also supports headless Client Portal API authentication via the modified [OAuth 1.0a](https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/) protocol. \nThis allows you to authenticate your application with the IBKR backend without having to run the gateway and provides more flexible deployment opportunities.\n\nAuthenticating Client Portal API with OAuth is currently only available to institutional clients. It has been successfully used to develop web and mobile apps, \nas well as to integrate with third-party solutions.\n\n---\n\n### Getting access to OAuth at Interactive Brokers\n\nTo use OAuth authentication, you will need to register your application with Interactive Brokers. Currently only institutional clients, organizational account types, can register their applications. Retail clients with an individual account type are not eligible to use OAuth.\n\nDepending on the type of application developed, clients will need to either send a request ticket via IBKR Client Portal Support Center, if the API client is developed in-house, or by \nemailing the Web API Onboarding team if the client application is being developed by a third-party.\n\n#### For apps developed in-house\n\nIn order to apply for OAuth access for applications developed in-house, or by a legal affiliate to the account, clients will need to send a request ticket via IBKR Client Portal Support Center. To speed up the process,\nplease include the following information in your request:\n\n- A confirmation that the application is being developed in-house\n- A list of accounts that will be used with the application\n- The main purpose of the application\n\nOnce the request has been received our development team will process it accordingly. We may ask for additional details at this stage. Once approved, a confirmation message outlining next steps, including access to our Github repository, where the API demo can be found, and access to the self-service OAuth portal will be sent out.\nThe OAuth portal makes it easy for clients to register their applications, and to manage their OAuth credentials.\n\n#### For apps developed by a third-party\n\nApps developed by a third-party to the account will need to be registered by the account owner. \nIn order to apply for OAuth access for applications developed by a third-party, clients will need to log a request in Client Portal’s Support Center. Further instructions will be provided as a response.\n\n---\n\n### Next steps\n\nDepending on whether your application is being developed in-house or by a third-party, you will need to follow slightly different steps in order to integrate OAuth with your client application. \nApproved applications developed in-house will be provided with the self-service portal. This allows clients to register their consumer key, upload encryption and signature keys, and manage their access tokens. \nIn the case of third-party apps, this information will be provided by the account owner as part of the onboarding process. In each case a demo environment along with detailed instructions on how to integrate OAuth will be provided.\n\n---\n";var Ut=Nt;const $t={class:"link-container"},Yt=["href"],Ht=["title"];function Wt(e,t,i,r,n,o){return(0,s.wg)(),(0,s.iD)("div",$t,[(0,s._)("a",{href:this.url,target:"_blank"},[(0,s._)("span",null,(0,u.zw)(this.title),1)],8,Yt),(0,s._)("i",{class:"fa-solid fa-circle-question",title:this.description},null,8,Ht)])}var Gt={props:{title:{type:String,required:!0},url:{type:String,required:!0},description:{type:String,required:!0}}};const Vt=(0,a.Z)(Gt,[["render",Wt]]);var zt=Vt,Qt={components:{BaseLayout:ne,DownloadCard:Tt,AccountToggle:Z,ResourceLink:zt,Warning:xt},data(){return{store:Q(),content:null,downloads:[{title:"Gateway",content:"Download a latest version of the Client Portal API gateway.",url:"https://download2.interactivebrokers.com/portal/clientportal.gw.zip"}]}},watch:{content(){hljs.highlightAll()}},computed:{activeTab(){let e="individual"==this.store.accountType?Ft:Ut,t=marked.parse(e);return this.content=t,t}}};const Kt=(0,a.Z)(Qt,[["render",Lt],["__scopeId","data-v-42cc8505"]]);var Xt=Kt;const Zt=e=>((0,s.dD)("data-v-d2aef520"),e=e(),(0,s.Cn)(),e),Jt={class:"content-header"},ei=Zt((()=>(0,s._)("h2",null,"Endpoints Explorer",-1))),ti=Zt((()=>(0,s._)("p",null," This page is intended to be used on a desktop or laptop.

Once connected, \nthe session needs to be authorized. This can be achieved in two ways:\n\n##### From a browser\n\nInclude the cookies from the 'set-cookie' headers from previous API requests. If you are using a browser to\ntest API functionality, this will generally be done automatically by the browser.\n\n##### From your client application\n\nRequest the sessionId from the **/tickle** endpoint and send it to the websocket endpoint in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    'session': 'sessionId'\n}\n```\n\n##### Sample Response\n\nIf the request is successful one of the following responses will be returned:\n\n```json\n{\n    'topic': 'sts', \n    'args': {\n        'authenticated': true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nor: \n\n```json\n{\n    'topic': 'system', \n    'success': 'username'\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Websocket Messages\n\nThere are two types of messages used by the websocket:\n\n- **Solicited messages:** messages that have been explicitly sent by the client\n- **Unsolicited messages:** messages that have been sent by the server, either as a response to a request or containing information about the connected session\n\nIn order to receive streaming data from the websocket, the relevant topic must be subscribed to. In order to do so,\na message of the format: **TOPIC+{ARGUMENTS}** must be sent to the websocket endpoint, where:\n\n- **TOPIC** represents the request that is being sent via the websocket\n- The plus symbol **+** is used as the message separator\n- **{ARGUMENTS}** contains a list of arguments passed as part of the request. An empty list {} needs to be passed if no arguments are required\n\nSolicited message topics are generally three characters in length and start with either an **s**, if the topic\nis being subscribed to, or an **u** if unsubscribing from a topic.\n\n---\n\n### Market Data\n\n#### Streaming Data\n\nStreaming, top-of-the-book market data is available for all instruments using Client Portal API's websocket endpoint. For streaming data the following message needs to be sent to the endpoint:\n\n``` json\nsmd+conId+{\n    arguments\n}\n```\n\nThe conId is the instrument's unique contract identifier within Interactive Brokers' database. \n\nContracts requested via this topic use SMART routing by default. If you wish to specify the exchange explicitly, \nthe passed contract identifier should be modified into the format **conId@EXCHANGE**, where EXCHANGE is the exchange on which the contract trades.\n\n**Tip:** The contract ID for a particular instrument can be found using the endpoint **/iserver/secdef/search**.\n\nIn order to unsubscribe from market data for the specified contract ID, the following message needs to be sent to the endpoint:\n\n``` json\numd+conId+{}\n```\n\n##### Example: Requesting streaming close price and daily percent change for APPL stock\n\nIn order to request streaming market data, a subscription request must first be sent for the specific contract. In this case, we know that the APPL@NASDAQ contract\nhas a contract ID of 265598. In addition, we must also specify the fields that should be returned. In this case we are interested in fields 31 - close price, and 83 - the % change, or difference between the last price and the close price for the previous day.\n\nFor a list of available tags please see the swagger documentation for the [/marketdata/snapshot](./endpoints#operations-tag-Market_Data) endpoint.  \n\n``` json\nsmd+265598+{\n    'fields':['31','83']\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Historical Data\n\nFor streaming historical data, the topic **smh+Id** is used. There are also optional parameters available in JSON format. \nIf no parameters are specified, the empty parameters array **{}** can be passed. \nIncorrectly specified parameters are ignored and the default (empty) response is returned. \nTo unsubscribe, the topic is **umh+serverId** can be used, where **serverID** is the server ID associated with the request.\n\n**NOTE:** Only a max of 5 concurrent historical data request available at a time.\n\nThe historical market data request takes the following parameters:\n\n<div class='scrollable-table-container'>\n    <table class='styled-table'>\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n                <th>Parameter</th>\n                <th>Description</th>\n                <th>Valid Values</th>\n            </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td>exchange: String</td>\n                <td>Contract exchange</td>\n                <td>Valid exchange on which the contract trades</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>period: String</td>\n                <td>Request duration</td>\n                <td>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>{1-30}min</li>\n                        <li>{1-8}h</li>\n                        <li>{1-1000}d</li>\n                        <li>{1-792}w</li>\n                        <li>{1-182}m</li>\n                        <li>{1-15}y</li>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>bar: String</td>\n                <td>Request bar size</td>\n                <td>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>1min</li>\n                        <li>2min</li>\n                        <li>3min</li>\n                        <li>5min</li>\n                        <li>10min</li>\n                        <li>15min</li>\n                        <li>30min</li>\n                        <li>1h</li>\n                        <li>2h</li>\n                        <li>3h</li>\n                        <li>4h</li>\n                        <li>8h</li>\n                        <li>1d</li>\n                        <li>1w</li>\n                        <li>1m</li>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>outsideRTH: Boolean</td>\n                <td>Request data outside trading hours</td>\n                <td>\n                    true/false\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>source: String</td>\n                <td>Type of date requested</td>\n                <td>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>midpoint</li>\n                        <li>trades</li>\n                        <li>bid_ask</li>\n                        <li>bid</li>\n                        <li>ask</li>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>format: String</td>\n                <td>Historical values returned</td>\n                <td>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>%o - open</li>\n                        <li>%c - close</li>\n                        <li>%h - high</li>\n                        <li>%l - low</li>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</div>\n\n##### Example: Requesting mutltiple historical values in a single request\n\nMultiple historical values can be requested using a single request by separating the fields to be returned with a forward slash, for example:\n\n``` json\nsmh+265598+{\n    'period': '1d',\n    'bar': '1min', \n    'source': 'trades', \n    'format': '%o/%c/%h/%l'\n}\n```\n\nreturns the open, close, high, and low trades prices for the last day with one minute bars.\n\n##### Example: Request AAPL historical trade high data for past 2 hours with 5 mins bars\n\n``` json\nsmh+265598+{\n    'exchange':'ISLAND',\n    'period':'2h',\n    'bar':'5min',\n    'outsideRth':false,\n    'source':'trades',\n    'format':'%h/%l'\n}\n```\n\nThe following response will be returned:\n\n``` json\n{\n    'serverId': '341115',\n    'symbol': 'AAPL',\n    'text': 'AAPLE INC',\n    'priceFactor': 100,\n    'startTime': '20210317-18:00:00',\n    'high': '12586/14469/65',\n    'low': '12283/34103/0',\n    'timePeriod': '7200s',\n    'barLength': 300,\n    'mdAvailability': 'S',\n    'mktDataDelay': 0,\n    'outsideRth': false,\n    'volumeFactor': 1,\n    'priceDisplayRule': 1,\n    'priceDisplayValue': '2',\n    'negativeCapable': false,\n    'messageVersion': 2,\n    'data': [...],\n    'points': 23, \n    'topic': 'smh+265598',\n}\n```\n\nNote the server ID associated with the subscription.

An example of a market depth response is:\n\n``` json\n{\n    'topic': 'sbd',\n    'data': [\n        {\n            'row': 0,\n            'focus': 1,\n            'price': 123.45\n        },\n        {\n            'row': 1,\n            'focus': 0,\n            'price': 123.44,\n            'ask': 200\n        },\n        {\n            'row': 2,\n            'focus': 0,\n            'price': 120.00,\n            'bid': 400\n        }\n    ],\n}\n```\n\nWhere, **row** is the row number of the market depth data, **focus** indicates the last price for the contract, **price** is the price for the current row, \nand **ask** and **bid** are the ask and bid sizes, respectively.\n\n---\n\n### Order & Positions Operations\n\n#### Live Order Updates\n\nAs long as an order is active, it is possible to retrieve it using Client Portal API. Live streaming orders can be requested by subscribing to the **sor** topic. \nOnce live orders are requested we will start to relay back when there is an update. \nTo receive all orders for the current day the endpoint **/iserver/account/orders** can be used. \nIt is advised to query all orders for the current day first before subscribing to live orders. \n\n``` json\nsor+{}\n```\n\nWhich returns the following sample response:\n\n``` json\n{\n    'topic': 'sor' ,\n    'args': [\n        {\n            'acct': 'DU1234',\n            'conid': 265598,\n            'orderId': 922048212,\n            'cashCcy': 'USD',\n            'sizeAndFills': '0/1',\n            'orderDesc': 'Buy 100 Limit 372.00 GTC',\n            'description1': 'AAPL',\n            'ticker': 'AAPL',\n            'secType': 'STK',\n            'listingExchange': 'NASDAQ.NMS',\n            'remainingQuantity': 100.0,\n            'filledQuantity': 0.0,\n            'companyName': 'APPLE INC',\n            'status': 'Submitted',\n            'origOrderType': 'LIMIT',\n            'supportsTaxOpt': '1',\n            'lastExecutionTime': '200708173551',\n            'lastExecutionTime_r': 1594229751000,\n            'orderType': 'Limit',\n            'side': 'BUY',\n            'timeInForce': 'GTC',\n            'price': 372,\n            'bgColor': '#000000',\n            'fgColor': '#00F000'\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nTo unsubscribe from streaming order updates, the topic **uor** needs to be sent to the websocket endpoint.\n\n``` json\nuor+{}\n```\n\nWhen there is an update to your order only the change to the order is relayed back along with the orderId.

It is recommended to call this endpoint approximately every minute.\n\n---\n\n#### Multiple usernames\n\nClients wishing to use multiple IBKR products at the same time (TWS, IBKR Mobile or Client Portal) can do so by creating a new username \nthat can then be used to log into other services while using the Client Portal API. \nTo create a second username please see the following [IBKR Knowledege Base](https://ibkr.info/node/1004) article. \n\n**Note:** In accordance with market data vendor requirements, market data services are user-specific and any username subscribed will be assessed a separate market data subscription fee.\n\n---\n\n#### Network Error while accessing endpoints\n\nIn order to use the endpoints and websockets functionality on the documentation page inside a web browser, Cross Origin Resource Blocking (CORB) \nneeds to be disabled from within the browser.\nSeveral extensions for both Chrome and Firefox are available to toggle CORB on and off from within the browser.\n\n**Tip:** CORB is disabled by default when using API testing tools such as Postman or Thunder Client.\n\n---\n\n#### Authenticating without a gateway\n\nIt is currently not possible for individual clients to authenticate a Client Portal API session without a gateway.\n\n---\n\n#### Opting out of 2FA\n\nSince the login process to the Client Portal API is the same as that for Client Portal, which has access to sensitve data such as funds and banking, it is \nnot possible to remove the requirement for the second factor device. This is only possible in some situations for trading applications such as TWS.\n\n---\n\n#### Automated login\n\nFor security reasons, automated login to Client Portal API is not currently supported for individual clients. The API gateway was designed to require\nthe end user to manually enter their credentials into a web browser to authenticate their brokerage session. \n\n**Note:** Interactive Brokers is unable to provide recommendations or support for third-party solutions that provide a workaround around this requirement.\n\n---\n\n#### Invalid SSL certificate\n\nSince the gateway is running on your premises, the certificate needs to be created and self-signed by you, or offically signed by a trusted third-party. \nThe gateway is similar to other webservers, such as Tomcat, which doesn't provide a certificate along with the release. To fix this issue, \nplease see the certificate generation steps below:\n\n- Create a self-signed certificate by following the following <a href=\"https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-using-java-keytool.html\">guide</a>.     \n- Place the generated *.jks certificate file in the 'root' folder in the gateway directory.\n- Update the sslCert field in the gateway configuration file with the details of the generated certificate.\n- Restart the gateway.\n\n---\n\n#### Pacing limitations\n\nInteractive Brokers has implemented pacing limits on endpoints accessible via Client Portal API. Currently a limit of 10 requests per second exists.\nIn addition some endpoint specific limits are also in place. These limits can be found in the table below.\n\nWhere this limit is exceeded, the API will return a \"429 Too Many Requests\" exception. Violator IP addresses are put in a penalty box for 10 minutes.\nAfter this period, the IP address is removed from the penalty box until another request exceeds the limit again. \nRepeat violator IP addresses can be permamently blocked until the issue is resolved. \n\n<div class='scrollable-table-container'>\n    <table class='styled-table'>\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n

body, for instance if it has carriage returns/newlines. \nPlease try first removing these and call the endpoint again.\n\n---\n\n### Market Data\n\n#### Snapshot Requests\n\nClient Portal API allows API consumers to request market data snapshots for most instruments. \nIn order to retrieve market data snapshots, the API consumer must first create a snapshot request subscription. \nThe response contains details about the subscribed snapshot request, the symbol, and requested fields.\nIn order to retrieve the market data, subsequent calls to the **/marketdata/snapshot** endpoint must be made.\n\n---\n\n#### Option Chains\n\nWhen requesting market data for options, set the strike price to zero to retrieve the entire option chain for that symbol.\n\n---\n\n### Account Data & Reports\n\n#### Portfolio discrepancies\n\nDue to filtering differences accross our platform, some discrepancies in portfolio data obtained via Client Portal API may be present.\nFor comparison purposes, statemenents generated via Client Portal or via Flex Queries should be considered as reliable sources of information.\n\n---\n\n#### Flex Queries\n\nGenerating complex reports is not currently supported in Client Portal API. Interactive Brokers does provide an alternative API, Flex Web Service, which allows for the retrieval of pre-made reports, known as Flex Queries, from Client Portal via HTTPS. \nTo learn more about Flex Query and the Flex Web Service API please refer to the official [Flex Web Service API](https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/am/am/reports/using_the_flex_web_service.htm) documentation. \n\n**Note:** A live account must be used when creating Flex Queries.\n\n---\n";var Ar=Ir;const kr="";var Sr=kr,Cr={components:{BaseLayout:ne,ScrollableSidenav:Di,AccountToggle:Z,Warning:xt},data(){return{store:Q(),content:null,activeSectionID:null}},methods:{onScroll(){let e=Array.prototype.slice.call(document.getElementsByTagName("h4")),t=e.reduce(((e,t)=>{let i=t.offsetTop;return e[i]=t.id,e}),{}),i=window.scrollY,r=25;for(let n in t)if(parseFloat(n)>=i-r)return void(this.activeSectionID=t[n])}},watch:{content(){hljs.highlightAll()}},created(){document.addEventListener("scroll",this.onScroll)},computed:{activeTab(){let e="individual"==this.store.accountType?Ar:Sr,t=marked.parse(e);return this.content=t,t},getSectionsList(){let e=document.createElement("div");e.innerHTML=this.content;let t=[];for(let i=0;i<e.children.length;i++){let r=e.children[i];"H3"==r.tagName&&t.push({category:r.innerText,titles:[]}),"H4"==r.tagName&&t[t.length-1].titles.push({id:r.id,title:r.innerText})}return t},getActiveSectionId(){return 0==this.getSectionsList.length?null:this.activeSectionID||this.getSectionsList[0].titles[0].id}}};const qr=(0,a.Z)(Cr,[["render",Tr]]);var xr=qr;const Pr=e=>((0,s.dD)("data-v-d38c5ece"),e=e(),(0,s.Cn)(),e),Dr=Pr((()=>(0,s._)("h2",null,"Changelog",-1))),Mr=Pr((()=>(0,s._)("p",null," This page showcases updates for both Client Portal API and it's Documentation page.
